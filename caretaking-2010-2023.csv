The few weeks between Thanksgiving and the end-of-year holidays are a time when eating becomes something more than a utilitarian need or even a personal pleasure. Now is the time of year when food’s cultural significance takes center stage in our overscheduled lives. We may eat standing at a desk most of the year, but during the holidays we are reconnected to food’s deeper meaning.","The New York Times","2022-11-29T10:00:14+0000","article","Opinion","Op-Ed","nyt://article/7ca5a13c-9fa4-5a51-94d8-119955cf36e2",NA,"Help Black Farmers, Who Know Hyperlocal Doesn’t Mean Fancy","Tressie McMillan Cottom",NA,"Help Black Farmers This Holiday Season",NA,NA,NA

"Great shows used to be about fallen masculinity. Now they’re about collaboration and resilience. What changed?","Great shows used to be about fallen masculinity. Now they’re about collaboration and resilience. What changed?","There is a moment in HBO’s “Doll & Em” when Em, a movie star, leaves her trailer to rehearse her lines alone. Doll, Em’s childhood best friend and now her assistant, stays behind. In an echo of “All About Eve,” Doll picks up her friend’s script and starts reading aloud. “ 'Why didn’t you call me?’ ‘I didn’t think it was my place,' ” she says, intoning both parts and knowing she’s overstepping. The script is terrible. It’s derivative. But it’s a transgressive moment for Doll and a distillation of her complicated envy toward Em. The sharp parody happening in that scene — of great films, of female friendship, of Hollywood’s idea of better roles for women — coexists with an air of unstudied sincerity that’s in fact subversive.

At 4:43 a.m., a security guard at the movie studio and theme park saw flames rising from a rooftop on the set known as New England Street, a stretch of quaint Colonial-style buildings where small-town scenes were filmed for motion pictures and television shows. That night, maintenance workers had repaired the roof of a building on the set, using blowtorches to heat asphalt shingles. They finished the job at 3 a.m. and, following protocol, kept watch over the site for another hour to ensure that the shingles had cooled. But the roof remained hot, and some 40 minutes after the workers left, one of the hot spots flared up.","The New York Times","2019-06-11T09:00:11+0000","article","Magazine","News","nyt://article/bae382af-283c-5e9a-9cf8-089f791d282d",NA,"The Day the Music Burned","Feature",NA,"The Day The Music Burned ",NA,NA,NA
