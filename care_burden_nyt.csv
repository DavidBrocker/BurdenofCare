In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results of a nationwide survey conducted during the last week in June: More than 40 percent of those who responded reported symptoms of anxiety or depression or increased substance use, in addition to other struggles. And more than 10 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days, compared with just over 4 percent who said the same thing in 2018 — and who were referring to suicidal ideation over the previous 12 months. “We want to know, who is most at risk from suicide in the pandemic,” says Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the survey. And yet, he adds, “we won’t know until it’s mostly over.” That’s because it can take a year or two for the C.D.C. to collect and analyze national mortality data.","The New York Times","2021-01-21T10:00:08+0000","article","Magazine","Magazine",NA,"News","nyt://article/56d50d32-a4c1-5ed8-b7ca-1fe0b602beb3",1370,"nyt://article/56d50d32-a4c1-5ed8-b7ca-1fe0b602beb3",NA,NA,"Will the Pandemic Result in More Suicides?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"By Kim Tingley",NA,266,170,28

In a 2013 Gallup poll about morally controversial issues, a mere 14 percent of the public said they accepted polygamy (only adultery and cloning humans had lower approval rates). An earlier poll found two-thirds of the public felt the government had a right to outlaw the practice, which typically takes the form of a married man also living in a marriage-type relationship with other women. So don’t read too much into the popularity of TV shows like “Sister Wives” and “Big Love.” The country is not ready for plural marriage.","The New York Times","2016-04-05T09:30:04+0000","article","BookReview","Books","Book Review","News","nyt://article/c676fa93-c8c1-5078-ad6b-c45482f0d76b",1341,"nyt://article/c676fa93-c8c1-5078-ad6b-c45482f0d76b","BR","31","Love in the Time of Monogamy","Ivory Tower",NA,"Love in the Time of Monogamy",NA,NA,NA,"By James Ryerson",NA,266,180,27
